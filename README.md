# Pokedex_PHP
***
For this exercise we have been challenged to adapt our [Pokedex project](https://github.com/JulioCesarTeixeira/Pokedex_API), which we did in Javascript, to PHP.

## Learning Objectives
***
-Starting with PHP
* To be able to write a simple condition and a simple loop
* To know how to access external resources (API)
* To know where to search for PHP documentation
* To find out how much easier it is to learn a second programming language

## Goals
***
Make a Pokédex using the PokeAPI.

Basic functionality that is expected (read: core features):

* You can search a pokémon by name and by ID
* Of said pokémon you need to show:
    * The ID-number 
    * An image (sprite)
    * At least 4 "moves"
    * The previous evolution, only if it exists, along with their name and image. Be carefull, you cannot just do ID-1 to get the previous form, for example look into "magmar" - "magmortar". You have to use a seperate api call for this!
    * Make your web page look like a pokédex by adding a little CSS.

### Extra challenge
***
There are a couple of pokemon that don't play with the normal rules, add code so their cases are also handled elegantly.

* Ditto only has 1 move.
* Eevee has 6 evolutions.
